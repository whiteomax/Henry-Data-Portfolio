# 📊 Project: Google Play Store App Analysis

## 🔍 Overview

Analyzed over 10,000 apps from the Google Play Store to identify key factors that influence install volume and user ratings. 
The goal was to provide actionable insights for app developers and marketers using EDA, statistical testing, sentiment analysis, and basic ML models.

## 📃 Dataset

* `googleplaystore.csv`: App metadata (ratings, installs, categories, etc.)
* `googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`: User reviews with sentiment labels

## 📈 Tools & Libraries

* Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
* Statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA)
* Sentiment analysis (TextBlob)
* Sklearn for regression/classification models

## 🔬 Key Steps & Methods

1. Cleaned and preprocessed inconsistent app entries and install ranges.
2. Used EDA to understand install/rating trends by category and rating group.
3. Applied Kruskal-Wallis & ANOVA to test category differences in install volume.
4. Analyzed user review sentiment and its relationship with installs.
5. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and Linear Regression to predict installs.

## 📊 Findings

* Categories like GAME and TOOLS dominate the high-install bracket.
* Install volumes peak at a rating of \~4.3; diminishing returns after that.
* Statistically significant differences found between high and low install categories.
* Sentiment polarity and subjectivity had weak correlation with installs.
* ML model performance limited by lack of continuous numerical install data.

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to clean messy real-world datasets, apply statistical tests correctly, extract marketing insights, and build basic predictive models.   
With richer feature engineering and continuous install data, future models could offer improved predictions.
