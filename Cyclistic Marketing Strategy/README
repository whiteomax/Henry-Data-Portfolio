ðŸš² Cyclistic Marketing Strategy Project

This project analyzes user behavior in a bike-share program using SQL, BigQuery, Google Cloud, Excel, and Tableau. 
It supports the design of a targeted marketing strategy to convert Casual users(non-subscribers) into annual members by uncovering key behavioral differences between user types.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Organization: Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago

Business Goal: Increase revenue by converting more casual users into annual members

Analytic Goal: Use historical ride data to identify usage patterns and build insights into rider segments that are most likely to convert.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
BigQuery handles large-scale ride datasets efficiently
Google Cloud Platform	Data storage, querying, and sharing
Excel	Data cleaning and initial filtering
Tableau	Interactive data visualization and station mapping

ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights

Ride Time Analysis:
Found that casual riders prefer weekends and afternoons, suggesting recreational usage, while members ride more on weekdays and during commuting hours.

Station Popularity Mapping:
Visualized start stations in Tableau. Popular casual stations were clustered around lakefront, parks, and tourist areas, further confirming recreational intent.

Bike Type Preferences:
Casual users showed a higher preference for electric bikes, potentially reflecting convenience or pricing sensitivity.

Trip Length Distribution:
Casual riders typically had longer average trip durations, but more variability, reinforcing non-commute patterns.

âœ… Final Recommendations

Based on behavioral differences, we proposed a targeted digital marketing strategy:

Promote annual memberships to casual users near tourist hotspots and lakeside areas.

Run time-based campaigns (e.g., Sunday special promotions).

Leverage social media and hashtags to engage casual users with strong brand visuals.

Introduce electric bike membership perks to attract convenience-focused casual riders.
